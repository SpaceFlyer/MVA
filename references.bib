% This file will serve as our group's single reference file.  Please
% follow the format of the references below, and be careful never to
% leave the file in a state that produces syntax errors.  Please make
% sure to include all the relevant information in each reference
% (authors' first names, page numbers, etc.), and if you use an older
% reference that is missing some information, please try to add this
% information to the file.  Also try to check if a newer version of
% the paper has come out (e.g., a journal version), and if so, update
% the reference.  Organizing the references by topic is nice
% but not required -- the important thing is how the references look
% in our papers, not in this file.  Try to place references next to
% related references, though.

% I think it is a good idea to maintain a master reference file for
% latex so that we can avoid retyping, and also look for appropriate
% references on a per topic basis.
%
% The bibtex master file is in ~sandholm/refs/dairefs.bib at this point.
% I have given everybody the access rights for reading and writing.
%
% To make this work, everyone has to be very careful when adding into
% the file.  Here are a couple of conventions that I have found useful,
% and I suggest that we use them in the future also.  They are of course
% open to discussion (but not open to undiscussed deviation).  :-)
%
% 1. Standard bibtex issues are followed, e.g. different keywords for
% books, proceedings, theses, tech reports, collection, journals etc.
%
% 2. The database is divided into sections, separated by section
% headers.  The first two sections were copied from other dai databases,
% but I generated the rest.  The sections correspond to topics,
% e.g. scheduling.  The references should be added in the appropriate
% section.  Nothing should be added into sections 1 and 2.
%
% 3. The references are alphabetically ordered in each section
% (according to the first author's last name).
%
% 4. The reference names are: first-author's-last-name + year +
% first-word-of-title.  E.g. Sandholm96:Leveled.  (This convention is
% not followed in sections 1 and 2, because they were generated by other
% people).
%
% 5.  A number of shorthand notations have been defined in the beginning
% of the file.  When they exist, they should be used to allow uniformity
% of how references look.  Feel free to add new shorthands.
%
%
% I have found that this saves a lot of time compared to the other latex
% referencing method.
%
% Let me know what you think.

% Best,

closely related to the coordinated attack problem. Two players have to
play one of two possible coordination games. Only one of them receives
information about the coordination game to be played. It is shown that
even if a large (but finite) number of propositions of the type 'i
knows that j knows that i knows... that the game is G' are true, the
game theoretic situation is very different from when the coordination
game played is common knowledge. The example emphasizes the importance
of the common knowledge assumption in game theory.",

percent said that was the main reason they shop online, said Susan
Grant, NCL Vice President for Public Policy and Director of its
Internet Fraud Watch program. The survey, conducted by Opinion
Research Corporation International, also showed that most consumers
are happy with their e-commerce experiences. One in five reported
problems with online purchases.  The most common problems were:
products or services that were misrepresented (8 percent); products or
services that were paid for, but never received (6 percent); charges
that were billed, but never authorized (3 percent); charges that were
more than the agreed price (1 percent).  Despite the fact that most
consumers said they prefer to pay for online orders with credit cards
(67 percent) and that few reported any problems in that regard, the
most common concern (41 percent) was that their credit card numbers
would be stolen if they gave them online. What is even more
distressing is that 69 percent of consumers incorrectly believe that
it is safer to pay for an online purchase by check or money order
rather than credit card, observed Grant. People don't realize that
encryption is commonly used to protect financial information during
transmission. And that federal law protects credit cards users if they
don't get what they were promised or unauthorized charges were made to
their accounts.",
