\section{Optimal Mechanisms with Both Seller's and Bidder's Cost}

In this section, we take out the constraint and prove that MVAs are optimal in
general. We will also try to find the specific MVA to achieve such optimality
and it turns out to be significantly more complicated than our previous
simplified case.

\subsection{Spending Equivalence Theorem and Revenue Optimization Strategy}

\begin{definition}

We say mechanisms satisfy relaxed efficiency constraint with lowest type $l$
if:

    \begin{enumerate}

    \item They only allocate the item to bidders whose valuation are at least
    $l$ (the lowest type is $l$)

    \item If they will allocate the item, they will always allocate the item to
    the bidder with highest valuation.

    \end{enumerate}

When we say a mechanism with a lowest type $l$, we imply that this mechanism
satisfy relatex efficiency constraint with lowest $l$.

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}

For all mechanisms with the same lowest type $l$, they will have the same
overall spending from all bidders (including bidders' bidding costs and
payments to sellers).

\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}

For mechanisms with a fixed lowest type $l$, the maximum utility for sellers is
achieved when the mechanism minizes the cost.

\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}

MVAs have the minimum cost among all mechanisms with a lowest type $l$

\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}

MVAs are optimal. (watch out for relaxed efficiency constraint)

\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}

Shall we increase lowest type $l$ a little above Myerson's optimal lowest type
to trade payment with cost? Or is it optimal to use Myerson's $l$ and then
minimize cost according to that?

\end{corollary}

\subsection{Experiments to Discover Optimal MVA with a Given Lowest Type}

\subsection{Analysis of Optimal MVA with Lowest Type}

\subsection{Using Piecewise Linear MVA to Approximate Optimal MVA}

\subsection{Choosing Lowest Type?}

\subsection{Experiments}

Now we are going to compare revenue in general cases. We not only compare our
approximate optimal MVAs to optimal MVAs computed numerically, but also compare
MVAs to other conventional mechanisms.
