\begin{abstract}
Iterative auctions can reach an outcome before all bidders have 
revealed all their preference information.  This can decrease costs
associated with communication, deliberation, and loss of privacy.
We propose an explicit cost model that is inspired by single-item
Internet auctions, such as those taking place on auction sites (eBay)
or via informal communication (craigslist, mailing lists). 
A nonzero bid comes at a cost to both the seller and the bidder, and
the seller can send broadcast queries at a cost.
Under this model, we study auctions that maximize the seller's profit 
(revenue minus seller cost).
We consider multi-round Vickrey auctions (MVAs), in which the seller
runs multiple Vickrey auctions, with decreasing reserve prices.
We prove that restricting attention to this class is without loss of
optimality, show how to compute an optimal MVA, and compare
experimentally to some other natural MVAs.
Among our findings are that (1) the expected total cost is bounded
by a constant for arbitrarily many bidders, and (2) the optimal MVA
and profit remain
the same as long as the total bid cost is fixed, regardless of which
portion of it belongs to the seller and which to the buyer.

\section{Introduction}

Auctions constitute a favored method for allocating scarce resources in
multiagent systems.  However, communication requirements can pose a
bottleneck.  Motivated by the revelation principle, much of the theory of
mechanism design considers {\em direct-revelation} mechanisms, in which
each agent declares its entire valuation function to the auctioneer.  The
corresponding overhead, not only in terms of communication per se but also
in terms of the agent having to completely {\em determine} its valuation
function, can be prohibitive.  All of this is well understood (for further
discussion, see, e.g.,~\cite{Conitzer04:Computational}), and a significant amount of research has been
devoted to the design of {\em iterative} auction mechanisms (e.g.,~\cite{Parkes06:Iterative}) and (roughly
equivalently) auctions with explicit {\em elicitation} of agents'
valuations (e.g.,~\cite{Sandholm06:Preference}).  Such auctions aim to avoid the communication of
unnecessary information.  For example, in a Vickrey auction, if it is
known that bidders 1 and 2 have valuations above \$100 and bidder 3 has one
below \$100, then there is no need to query bidder 3 any further.

How do we evaluate how effective a particular iterative auction mechanism
is in reducing communication?  Perhaps the simplest measure is the number
of bits communicated (see, e.g.,~\cite{}).  Within a particular query
model, it may also make sense to minimize the total number of queries (see,
e.g.,~\cite{}). However, in this paper, we argue that such existing models
fail to capture important aspects of the cost of communication in certain
types of Internet auctions.  In particular, in such auctions often the most
costly communication that takes place is the {\em first} time that a bidder
gives a positive response, indicating having a nonzero value for an item.
This can be the case for several reasons.  One possibility is that the
auction website at this point may insist that the bidder provides payment
(say, credit card) information or places money in escrow.  Otherwise, a
malicious user may steer the auction in a particular direction and in the
end refuse to pay.  Alternatively, in other settings (such as an item
having been posted for sale on craigslist or a similar list), at this point
the bidder may wish to set up an appointment with the seller to check the
item.  In both cases, these actions come at costs for both the potential
buyer and the seller, in terms of effort and time, loss of privacy, and 
various risks.
%The bidding costs $c$ may be caused by communication and other verification
%required to bid. For example, the bidder may have to input his credit card
%number and prepay an amount of money. Without such verification, a bidder may
%bid very high and refuse to pay in the end. 
%A verification for the seller might
%also be needed. For example, a bidder may want to set up an appointment with
%the seller to check the item.  Setting up such an appointment might be costly
%because they need to dicuss time and place via emails or phone calls.
%Attending that appointment may also cost travel fees and time.  
While participation costs have been studied before in
%Note that our
%bidding cost is different from conventional participation cost studied before
auctions~\cite{Stegeman95:ParticipationCost,
  Tan2006:EquilibriaParticipationCost}, a distinguishing feature of our
model is that a bidder can observe the proceedings of the auction at no
cost, until the bidder decides to actively participate by at some  indicating a
nonzero valuation and thereby changing the course of the auction.   This
appears to us to be a more natural model of Internet (or other highly
anonymous) auctions of the type discussed above.
%In
%our model, it is free for bidders to participate without bidding, which is more
%close to most Internet platforms. In another word, bidders do not have to buy a
%ticket to walk in and observe.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  In
Section~\ref{sec:model}, we provide a formal model of elicitation cost
motivated by the observations just discussed.  In
Section~\ref{sec:efficient}, we study the special case in which efficient
allocation is a constraint and bidders experience no cost from bidding.
The characterization of the optimal mechanism in this special case turns
out to be closely related to earlier work on finding an optimal agent by
iteratively relaxing the parameters of the search~\cite{}.  In
Section~\ref{sec:general}, we drop the assumptions of efficiency and no
bidder cost for elicitation.
