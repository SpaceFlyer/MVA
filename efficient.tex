\section{Optimal Mechanisms with Efficiency and Only Seller's Cost}
\label{sec:efficient}

In this section, we make two simplifying assumptions: (1) we restrict
attention to mechanisms that allocate the item efficiently and (2) we
assume that the bidder cost for replying ($\beta_2$) is zero.\footnote{Note
that if (2) does not hold, then allocating efficiently may not be possible
without the seller compensating the bidders for their bidding costs.}
%we consider a simplified optimizing problem with efficiency
%constraint and only seller's cost.  Though these two constraints simplify our
%problem a lot, they are reasonable in real cases such as craigslist or moving
%sales in mailing-lists. 
For example, someone who is moving and selling furniture on craigslist is
likely to have $0$ valuation for the item 
and cannot commit to withhold the item or prevent re-sale between
bidders. Under such circumstances,  efficient mechanisms not only maximizes the
social welfare but also maximizes the seller's revenue
\cite{Ausubel99:EfficientOptimality} (though this does not consider
elicitation costs).
% Besides, every bidder would at most be
%charged for one bidding but the seller will be charged for all
%biddings. Thus it also seems reasonable to ignore bidder's bidding cost
%for simplicity.
In Section~\ref{sec:general} we drop these assumptions.


%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item In many cases, sellers only have $0$ valuation for the item.
%For example, some second-hand items will be tossed if they cannot be sold by a
%particular day, e.g. the day the seller moves out the house. We encounter many
%free items during second-hand sales as well, which is another demonstration of
%zero valuation. Additionally, sellers cannot commit to withhold the item or 
%prevent re-sales between buyers. Under such circumstances, an efficient mechanism not only
%maximzes the social welfare but also maximizes the seller's revenue \cite{Ausubel99:EfficientOptimality}.
%
%\item The bidding cost for each bidder sometimes seems \footnote{But actually
%it is not that negligible as our example seems to claim. In later section,
%theorem \ref{theorem:equivalence} will show exactly how important it is.} to be
%negligible compared to bidding cost charged to the seller. For example, if
%$100$ bidders replied to the seller by a $1$-minue call, each bidder only has a
%tiny $1$ minue cost.  But for the seller, it is a big $100$ minutes cost which
%is very annoying. It is also necessary to remove bidder's bidding cost to
%achieve efficiency (without compensation).  Otherwise, the item may not be able
%to allocate to the highest bidder when that highest valuation is below the
%bidder's bidding cost.
%
%\end{enumerate}

The rest of this section is organized as follows. First, we
introduce a class of mechanisms called multi-round Vickrey auctions (MVA).
%based on
%what has been used in realworld online second-hand item transactions.  
Then,
we prove that we can restrict attention to MVAs without loss of optimality.
%(so there exists a MVA that is
%optimal). A
After that, we find the specific MVA that is optimal. Finally, we
experimentally compare this optimal MVA to some other natural mechanisms.

\subsection{Multi-round Vickrey Auctions}


In an MVA, the seller runs a Vickrey auction with a reserve price; if
nobody bids (above the reserve price), the seller runs another Vickrey
auction with a lower reserve price, etc., until the item is sold.  (In
Section~\ref{sec:general}, we will also consider MVAs that can terminate
without having sold the item.)
%n MVA has multiple rounds of Vickrey
%auctions with progressively decreasing reserve prices. 
For example, consider a sequence of eBay auctions (with proxy bidding) in
which the seller is repeatedly lowering the reserve price.


%This kind of auction
%effectively occurs on eBay. The seller may set up a reserve price and let
%buyers bid for this item. The proxy bidding functionality makes such an auction
%equivalent to a Vickrey auction with a reserve price. If no buyers bid for a
%given reserve price, the seller may lower the reserve price, which makes the
%whole process equivalent to an MVA.

\begin{definition}[Multi-round Vickrey Auction (MVA)]
  An MVA is defined by a sequence of reserve prices $r_1, r_2, \ldots$
  (which may be finite or infinite) where $r_i > r_{i+1}$. In round $i$, a
  Vickrey auction with reserve price $r_i$ is run (if the item has not been
  sold yet).
%The seller creates a Vickrey
%auction with a reserve price $r_i$ at time $i$ (or round $i$). In each
%Vickrey auction, if only one buyer bids, he/she gets the item and pays reserve
%price. Otherwise, the buyer with the highest bidding gets the item and pays the
%second highest bidding.
\end{definition}

%MVAs require Vickrey auctions (or equivalent English auctions) as basic steps.
%In reality, however, such functionality won't always be provided by online
%platforms such as craigslist. Thus a simplified version of MVA occur very often
%in those platforms. People call it first-come first served which means for
%every reserve price $r_i$, the first one who accept that price wins the item
%and pays $r_i$ directly. This mechanism may loose revenue and social efficiency
%as the person with lower valuation $p$ may get the item for $r_i$ while there's
%someone else who is willing to pay a higher amount of $q$ where $r_i \leq p < q
%< r_{i-1}$. We won't focus on this first-come first served mechanism because
%it's harder to analyze analytically and it's inferior than MVAs in terms of
%both sellers' utility and social welfare.

%Since there is no cost charged to buyers, 
In an MVA, {\em if} a bidder decides to bid (above the reserve price), it
is optimal to bid truthfully since doing so is dominant in a Vickrey auction.
However, a bidder may choose strategically to stay silent even with a
valuation above the reserve price, in the belief that nobody else will bid this
round so that the price will decrease in the next round.
%it is obvious to see that whenever a
%bidder decides to bid, he/she must bid truthfully. 
%vc: could make this a proposition...  not clear it's worth it.  is there a
%reference? mcafee and vincent?
Thus, in our (symmetric) setting, Bayes-Nash
Equilibria (BNE)
 for MVAs can be described by a sequence of thresholds $a_1, a_2,
\ldots$ where $a_i > a_{i+1}$; in round $i$, a bidder bids if and only
if his valuation is at least $a_i$.
%Whenever a bidder's valuation for the item
%is greater than $a_i$, he/she is going to bid in round $i$ whose reserve price
%is $r_i$. 


We will be interested in the following question: given desired thresholds
$a_i$, which reserve prices $r_i$ result in these thresholds?  Then, by the
revelation principle, we can convert this to a mechanism in which we query
agents whether their valuations are above $a_i$ and it is optimal for them
to respond truthfully.

%In later analysis, we firstly decide thresholds $a_i$ since they are more
%meaningful for bidders to make decisions and for us to make analysis. Then we
%determine the right reserve prices $r_i$ that make bidders incentive compatible
%to bid according to thresholds $a_i$. 

\begin{lemma}
  Consider a symmetric strategy profile in an MVA where in the $i$th round,
  valuation $a_i$ is the threshold for bidding (so that bidders with lower
  valuations stay silent and those with higher valuations bid).  Then this
  constitutes a Bayes-Nash equilibrium if:
\begin{align}\label{eq:MVA_eq}
%    &r_k = a_k = 0 \mbox{ and }
    %&\forall i, i+1\nonumber\\% ~(1 \leq i < k),\nonumber\\
    &~~P(a_{i})(a_{i}-r_i) =
    \int_{a_{i+1}}^{a_{i}}(a_{i}-x)p(x)dx+P(a_{i+1})(a_{i}-r_{i+1})
\end{align}
(where 
%\begin{align*}
$P(x) := F(x)^{n-1}$ and $p(x) := P'(x) = (n-1)F(x)^{n-2} f(x)$)
%\end{align*}
when $i$ is not the last round, and either $a_i=r_i$ when $i$ is the last
round or $\lim_{i \rightarrow \infty} a_i = \lim_{i \rightarrow \infty}
r_i$.
\label{lemma:sufficient}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  Consider a bidder with valuation $a_i$; we first show that in round $i$,
  such a bidder is indifferent between bidding and staying silent if the
  condition holds.  If $i$ is the last round, clearly he is indifferent
  between bidding and not iff $a_i=r_i$.  We now consider the case where
  $i$ is not the last round.  If another bidder bids in round $i$, that
  bidder will bid at least $a_i$, and our bidder will have zero utility.
  Therefore, the left-hand side of (\ref{eq:MVA_eq}) represents the
  expected utility to our bidder for bidding now.  Corresponding to the
  right-hand side, if our bidder stays silent, and there is a next round
  and our bidder bids in that next round, then he will win in that round,
  either with another bidder bidding (first term) or not (second term).

  If we now consider a bidder with valuation above $a_i$, a similar
  analysis shows that this bidder strictly prefers bidding in round $i$ to
  waiting one more round; inductively, he will prefer it to waiting any
  number $k > 0$ more rounds; and he will also prefer this to never bidding
  because either $a_j=r_j$ when $j$ is the last round or $\lim_{j
    \rightarrow \infty} a_j = \lim_{j \rightarrow \infty} r_j$.   Finally,
  let us consider a bidder whose valuation lies below all the $a_i$.
  Because either $a_j=r_j$ when $j$ is the last round or $\lim_{j
    \rightarrow \infty} a_j = \lim_{j \rightarrow \infty} r_j$, this bidder
  is best off never bidding.
\end{proof}

%The equation \ref{eq:MVA_eq} says that the bidder with valuation $a_i$ should be
%indifferent from bidding in round $i$ (the left hand side) or bidding in round
%$i+1$(the right hand side).  The following theorem describes the equilibrium of
%MVAs determined by equations above.

For a mechanism that allocates efficiently, we either have $r_k = a_k = 0$
for some $k$, or $\lim_{i \rightarrow \infty} r_i = 0$.

\begin{theorem}
Given a decreasing sequence of $a_i \in [0,1)$ that ends at or converges to
$0$, let
\begin{align}\label{eq:MVA_eq_relation}
%  r_k &= a_k = 0 \nonumber \\
  r_i &= \left( \int_{0}^{a_i} x \, p(x) dx \right) / P(a_i) & (\mbox{if $a_i > 0$})
\end{align}
and $r_i=0$ if $a_i=0$. The corresponding MVA has a pure strategy Bayes-Nash equilibrium characterized by
bidding thresholds $a_1, a_2, \ldots$.
%. where the bidder with valuation at least $a_i$
%but less than $a_{i-1}$ (presumably $a_0 = 1$) will bid in round $i$ 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We show that the conditions of Lemma~\ref{lemma:sufficient} hold.  If $i$
is the last round, then $a_i=0=r_i$.  Also, $\lim_i r_i \leq \lim_i
\left( \int_{0}^{a_i} a_i \, p(x) dx \right) / P(a_i) = \lim_i a_i = 0$.  
If $i$ is not the last round, then 
by (\ref{eq:MVA_eq_relation}), we have $r_i P(a_i) = \int_{0}^{a_i}
x\,p(x)dx$ for all $i$ (this clearly also holds if
$a_i = 0$). Thus the right-hand side of equation \ref{eq:MVA_eq} is:
\begin{align*}
	& \int_{a_{i+1}}^{a_i} a_i p(x) dx - \int_{a_{i+1}}^{a_i} x \, p(x) dx + P(a_{i+1})(a_i-r_{i+1}) \\
	&= a_i P(a_i) - \cancel{a_i P(a_{i+1})} - r_i P(a_i) + \cancel{r_{i+1} P(a_{i+1})} \\
		& ~~~ + \cancel{P(a_{i+1}) a_i} - \cancel{P(a_{i+1}) r_{i+1}}\\
	&= \mbox{left hand side of (\ref{eq:MVA_eq})}
\end{align*}
\end{proof}
%vc: think about the inefficient allocation case?

This tells us that a bidder will bid in a round of an MVA if and only if
the expected second-highest bid conditional on this bidder's valuation
being the highest is greater than the reserve price of that round. For
example, if the distribution is uniform, we have $r_i = \frac{n-1}{n}
a_i$. 

A similar analysis to the one in this subsection (in a model that
includes discounting) appears in~\cite{McAfee97:SequentialAuctions}.  
However, that paper does not consider communication costs, and so we
diverge from that work in what follows.
%has given some more discussions
%and proof (e.g. once a bidder choose to bid, bid truthfully is a unique
%weekly dominant strategy) about the equilibrium of this kind of sequential
%auctions.  That paper, however, aims on the optimal auctions for a
%different cost model with time discount but without broadcast or bidding
%cost. We will discuss this difference later when we introduces bidding cost
%for bidders.

\subsection{Optimality of MVAs}


%vc: need to add no-gap assumption from revenue equivalence to model
%(anything else?)
Since the mechanism is required to be efficient and bidders' communications
costs ($\beta_2$) are zero, any mechanism that gives utility zero to an
agent with valuation zero results in the same revenue for the seller, by
the revenue equivalence theorem~\cite{Myerson:1981}.\footnote{Moreover, by
  individual rationality we cannot give an agent with valuation zero less
  than zero utility; we could give such an agent more than zero utility (as
  in redistribution mechanisms~\cite{}), but this would only hurt revenue.}
Hence, maximizing profit is equivalent to minimizing the seller's query
costs.

By the revelation principle, we can restrict our attention to mechanisms in
which agents always answer queries truthfully in equilibrium.\footnote{For
  example, for MVAs, we can directly query the agents whether their
  valuations are above the $a_i$ while still charging according to the
  $r_i$.}  By Proposition~\ref{prop:sufficient}, we can assume that an
agent reveals his entire valuation when not staying silent.  By the
efficiency constraint, the mechanism must at least discover a bidder with
the highest valuation.  This optimization problem corresponds to
Definition~\ref{def:query}.  We will then prove that MVAs can achieve this
lower bound and are hence optimal.

%he best case is that every reply contains the exact
%and truthful valuation of the corresponding bidder since every reply (or
%bidding) has a cost $c$. By doing that, we never need someone to reply twice.
%The optimizing problem in this best case is defined as definition
%\ref{def:query}.  This best case minimum cost provides us a lower bound for
%minimum cost of our mechanisms. We will then prove that MVAs can achieve this
%lower bound so they are optimal.

\begin{definition}\label{def:query}
  A {\em (direct-revelation) query} is given by a subset $Q \subseteq
  [0,1)$, such that if the agent's valuation is in $Q$, he replies with his
  exact valuation, and otherwise stays silent.  The cost of a query is $b+j
  \cdot c$ where $j$ is the number of bidders who do not stay silent. 
A strategy for asking queries can be represented by a function
\begin{displaymath}
	S\big(f, m, V, \mathcal Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_{i-1} \}\big) = Q_i
\end{displaymath}
which means: 
suppose that the set of queries asked previously is
$\mathcal Q$, the set of values already reported is $V$, and there are $m$
bidders left who have not responded (whose valuations were drawn
i.i.d.~from $f$); then the strategy $S$ will next ask $Q_i$.
%suppose there are still $m$ i.i.d.unknown values left whose PDF
%is $f(x)$, the reported values set is $V$ and the set of queries asked is
%$\mathcal Q$, the strategy $S$ will make $Q_i$ as the next query.

%Assume there are $n$ values $v_i ~(1 \leq i \leq n)$ independently and
%identically distributed over $[0, 1)$ with PDF $f(x)$ and CDF $F(x)$.  A query
%strategy is to find the maximum value by asking queries $Q_1, Q_2, \ldots$
%sequentially where $Q_i \subset [0, 1)$ and $\forall i \neq j, ~Q_i \cap Q_j =
%\emptyset$.  After a query $Q_i$, all numbers within $Q_i$ will be reported.
%Note that $Q_i$ may depend on results of $Q_1$ to $Q_{i-1}$. Thus a
%strategy can be denoted as a function:
%\begin{displaymath}
%	S\big(f, m, V, \mathcal Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_{i-1} \}\big) = Q_i
%\end{displaymath}
%which means, suppose there are still $m$ i.i.d. unknown values left whose PDF
%is $f(x)$, the reported values set is $V$ and the set of queries asked is
%$\mathcal Q$, the strategy $S$ will make $Q_i$ as the next query.

%The cost of each query is equal to $b+j \cdot c$ where $j$ is the number of
%reported values from that query. 
$C_{f,n}(S)$ is the expected cost of strategy $S$, and we wish to find
$C_{f,n}^* = \inf_S C_{f,n}(S)$.
%The cost of a strategy for a given set of
%unknown values $v_i$ is equal to the sum of all queries' costs it has to make
%before identifying the maximum value. The optimal query strategy is the one
%that has minimum expected cost.  We will write such minimum expected cost as
%$C^*(f, n)$, a function of PDF $f(x)$ and number of unknown values in the
%beginning $n$.
\end{definition}

To find out the optimal query strategy, we first introduce
a lemma saying that the minimum cost is independent of PDF $f(x)$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:uniform}

Assume uniform PDF $u(x) = 1$ and define $C^*(n) = C^*(u, n)$.
For any other PDF $f(x)$, we have 
\[C^*(f, n) = C^*(u, n) = C^*(n)\]

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

Define $F^{-1}(x) = \sup\{y ~|~ F(y) = x\}$. For any strategy $S_f$ that works
for PDF $f$, we can come up with a strategy $S_{u|f}$ for uniform PDF $u$:

$
S_{u|f}\big(u, m, V, \mathcal Q \big) = F\Big( S_f\big( f, m, F^{-1}(V), F^{-1} (\mathcal Q) \big) \Big)
$

Thus $C^*(u, n) \leq C^*(f, n)$ since we can adopt any strategy for $f$ to run
under $u$ with the same cost.  Similarly, for any strategy $S_u$ that works for
PDF $u$, we can make strategy $S_{f|u}$ for PDF $f$:

$
S_{f|u}\big(f, m, V, \mathcal Q \big) = F^{-1}\Big( S_u\big( u, m, F(V), F (\mathcal Q) \big) \Big)
$

Therefore $C^*(f, n) \leq C^*(u, n)$. Combining with $C^*(u, n) \leq C^*(f, n)$
we have $C^*(f, n) = C^*(u, n) = C^*(n)$. Figure \ref{fig:uniform} 
illustrates those two constructions we used for this proof.

\end{proof}

\begin{figure}
\centering
  \subfigure[Construct $S_{u|f}$ from $S_f$]{
    \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{figures/S-f-to-u}
    \label{fig:S-t-to-u}
  }
  \subfigure[Construct $S_{f|u}$ from $S_u$]{
    \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{figures/S-u-to-f}
    \label{fig:S-u-to-f}
  }
  \caption{These two figures illustrates how to construct a strategy for
  uniform PDF $u$ from another strategy for another arbitrary PDF $f$ and vice
  versa. Here we depict a strategy as a box which takes four inputs $f, m, V,
  \mathcal Q$ (PDF, number of unknown values, reported values set, set of asked
  queries) and make an output $Q$ (the next query)} \label{fig:uniform}
\end{figure}

Then we prove that descending query strategies are optimal:
\begin{lemma}\label{lemma:descending}

There exists an optimal strategy with only descending queries
$Q_1 = [a_1, 1], ~Q_2 = [a_2, a_1), ~Q_3 = [a_3, a_2)\ldots$

\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}

If not, there must be an optimal strategy where none of its
non-descending queries can be changed to descending queries without increasing
the cost. In that strategy $S$, there must be a first non-descending query
$Q_{i+1} = S\big(F, m, V, \mathcal Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_i\}\big)$ where
$Q_1$ to $Q_i$ are all descending.  We can make another descending query
$Q'_{i+1} = [a'_{i+1}, a_i)$ (or $Q'_{i+1} = [a'_{i+1}, 1]$ if $i = 0$) such
that
\[
\Pr(v \in Q_{i+1}) = \int \limits_{Q_{i+1}} f(x) \mathrm d x = \int \limits_{Q'_{i+1}} f(x) \mathrm d x = \Pr(v \in Q'_{i+1})
\]
After $Q'_{i+1}$, we will use as optimal query as
possible.

Since $Q_1$ to $Q_i$ are all descending, we have $m = n$ and $V = \emptyset$ (otherwise
the strategy should terminate without asking $Q_{i+1}$).
Define $C$ to be the expected cost of using $Q_{i+1}$ and later queries. Similarly we define $C'$ for $Q'_{i+1}$:\\
$
C = b + \sum_{j=0}^n p_j ( j \cdot c + C_j)
$
and
$
C' = b + \sum_{j=0}^n p'_j ( j \cdot c + C'_j)
$
where:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item 
$p_j$ (or $p'_j$) is the probability that there are $j$ reported values within $Q_{i+1}$ (or $Q'_{i+1}$);
%\item 
$C_j$ (or $C'_j$) is the expected cost of later queries given that $j$ values have been
found in $Q_{i+1}$ (or $Q'_{i+1}$).
%\end{enumerate}

As $\Pr(v \in Q_{i+1}) = \Pr(v \in Q'_{i+1})$, we have $p'_j = p_j$. Since $Q'_{i+1}$ is a
descending query, $\forall j > 0, ~C'_j = 0 \leq C_j$. And by lemma \ref{lemma:uniform},
$C'_0 = C_0 = C^*(n)$ because knowing no value is in $Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_{i+1}$ is equivalent
to revise PDF $f(x)$ to a refined PDF 
\[
f_{i+1}(x) = \begin{cases}
	\lambda f(x), & x \notin Q_1 \cup Q_2 \cup \ldots \cup Q_{i+1} \\
	0, & x \in Q_1 \cup Q_2 \cup \ldots \cup Q_{i+1}
\end{cases}
\]
where $\lambda$ is a constant to make $\int_0^1 f_{i+1}(x) dx = 1$.

Thus $C' \leq C$ which contradicts to that no non-descending query can be changed to
descending query without increasing the cost.

\end{proof}

Finally we have

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:MVA_eq}

Among all mechanisms that can include multiple rounds of broadcasts and are
required to be efficient (allocate the item to the bidder with highest
valuation), Multi-round Vickrey Auctions (MVAs) are of minimum cost.

\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}

The best case optimizing problem defined in definition \ref{def:query} provides
us a lower bound of minimum cost we can achieve by any mechanisms.  By lemma
\ref{lemma:descending}, such lower bound minimum cost can be achieved by
descending query strategy $Q_1 = [a_1, 1], Q_2 = [a_2, a_1), Q_3 = [a_3, a_2)
\ldots$.  And by theorem \ref{theorem:MVA_eq} we are able to design such an MVA
with reserve prices $r_1, r_2, \ldots$  whose Bayesian Nash Equilibrium
achieves this best case descending query strategy.  Thus, MVAs are of minimum cost.

\end{proof}

And by revenue equivalence theorem, MVAs are optimal:

\begin{corollary}

If all broadcast costs and bidding costs are charged to sellers, MVAs are
optimal if efficiency is required.  Such optimal MVA is the one that minimizes
the overall cost.

\end{corollary}

\subsection{Cost Minimized $\alpha$-MVA}\label{sec:alpha-MVA}

Now let us try to calculate the parameters (thresholds $a_i$ or equivalently
reserve prices $r_i$) of the optimal MVA for a given settings $F, n, b, c$
(valuation CDF, number of bidders, broadcast cost, bidding cost). By lemma
\ref{lemma:uniform}, the cost is indifferent with $F$ and we can always derive
an optimal mechanism for any $F$ from a uniform distribution. Thus we will
focus on uniform cases below. We will also introduce $\rho = \frac{b}{c}$ to
simplify our analysis by normalize bidding cost $c$ to $1$ and thus broadcast
cost $b$ to $\rho$.

An optimal MVA must be an $\alpha$-MVA where each round only $(1-\alpha) n$
bidders are expected to bid, i.e. $a_1 = \alpha, a_{i+1} = \alpha \cdot a_i$
for uniform cases. Then the expected overall cost $C$ satisfies: $ C = \rho +
(1-\alpha)n+\alpha^n C$. In the right hand side, the first term $\rho$ is the
broadcast we have to use in the first round, the second term $(1-\alpha)n$ is
the expected bidding cost for the first round, the third term $\alpha^n C$ is
a recursive term, the probability that no one bids times if that
happens the same cost $C$ should be expected in later rounds.  

From that equation, we get $C = \frac{
\rho+(1-a)n }{ 1-\alpha^n }$. To minimize cost $C$, we either choose boundary
cases $\alpha = 0, 1$ or we have: 

\begin{align}\label{eq:alpha}
\frac{\partial C}{\partial \alpha} = \frac{{\alpha}^{n-1}\,n\,\left(
\rho+\left( 1-\alpha\right) \,n\right) }{{\left( 1-{\alpha}^{n}\right)
}^{2}}-\frac{n}{1-{\alpha}^{n}} &= 0 \nonumber\\
&\Updownarrow\nonumber\\
\alpha^{n-1} (\rho + (1-\alpha)n) - (1-\alpha^n) &= 0
\end{align}

The boundary case $\alpha = 0$ can be ruled out because $\frac{\partial
C}{\partial \alpha} |_{\alpha = 0} < 0$.
%\footnote{As a result of $\alpha \neq 0$, optimal $\alpha$-MVA always has
%infinite many rounds which seems to refine the result in [cite Increasing
%Threshold Search] which claims it's either one round or infinite many rounds.
%However, in their work, the total bidding cost isn't necessarily linear with
%the number of biddings. Thus it's a more general proof than our linear case.}  
When $\alpha = 1$, $\alpha$-MVA becomes Dutch Auction thus $\rho$ must be $0$
(otherwise total broadcast cost would be infinity). And this is indeed a
solution of equation \ref{eq:alpha} when $\rho = 0$. Thus equation
$\ref{eq:alpha}$ characterize the optimal $\alpha$ in all cases.
\cite{SarneSR2010:IncreasingSearch} has a proof for why $\alpha$-MVA is optimal
among MVAs and how to determine $\alpha$ as well. Thus if they not
intuitive please reference more details there.  Our simplified cost model
(with efficiency constraint and no buyer's cost) is equivalent to their cost
model where learning cost is linear to the number of replied agents.  That
paper makes descending query as a contraint \footnote{In their model they want
to find the minimum value so increasing threshold search is equivalent to
descending query} and proves that $\alpha$-MVA is optimal among descending
query mechanisms. Our focus in this section, however, is to have a preliminary
introduction for MVA and proves optimality of descending queries and eventually
MVAs. Thus we omit the proof about $\alpha$-MVA. Even for the $\alpha$, we will
be more interested in its relation with larger $n$ so we will give
approximations for $\alpha$.

\subsection{Approximation of $\alpha$}

It is difficult to get an exact closed formula for optimal $\alpha$ by equation
\ref{eq:alpha}. Thus we are going to use some simpler formulas to approximate
$\alpha$. We will conduct experiments to compare our approximation with the
optimal $\alpha$ that is computed numerically. 

Firstly, $\alpha = 1-1/n$ is a natural guess which means each round the
expected number of biddings is equal to $1$. It turns out to be quite good:

\begin{theorem}
$\alpha = 1-1/n$ is a $1/(1-e^{-1})$ approximation of optimal $\alpha$-MVA.
That means, by simply choosing $\alpha = 1-1/n$, we would at most get about
$1.582$ times of optimal cost. Another obersavation of this approximation is
that no matter how large $n$ is, the cost of this simple approximation is at
most $(\rho+1) / (1-e^{-1}) = O(1)$. Thus the optimal cost is bounded by
constant $O(1)$ no matter how large $n$ is.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
$C(\alpha = 1-1/n) = (\rho+1)/(1-(1-1/n)^n)$. Because $(1-1/n)^n \leq e^{-1}$,
we have $C(\alpha = 1-1/n) \leq (\rho+1)/(1-e^{-1})$.  It is obvious that at
least one broadcast and one bidding is required to terminate so $C \geq
\rho+1$. This completes the proof.
\end{proof}

A better approximation when $n$ is large is to observe that $\alpha \rightarrow
1$ when $n$ grows large.  Thus we guess 
%\footnote{We tried several guesses and
%this is the one that finally turns out to work. Note that $(1-\alpha)n$ must be
%bounded (otherwise optimal cost won't be bounded by $O(1)$ as well) thus it's
%either a constant or a weird perturbation. It's natural to try constant first}
that $(1-a)n \approx A$ (for some constant $A$) and $\alpha^n \approx
\alpha^{n-1}$. Then we have: 
$$ n (\rho+A) \cdot \alpha^n - n(1-\alpha^n) = 0 $$ 
which gives us $\alpha = (1+\rho+A)^{-1/n}$. Put this back to $\lim_{n
\rightarrow \infty} (1-a)n = A$ we have $\ln (1+\rho+A) = A$ which gives us
\begin{align}\label{eq:approx2}
A = -1-\rho-W(-1-\rho)\nonumber\\
\alpha = (-W(-1-\rho))^{-1/n} 
\end{align}
where $W(x)$ is the Lambert W function [cite wikipedia?] defined by $W(x)
e^{W(x)} = x$. Actually, $w\,e^w = x$ has two solutions for $w$ when $-1 < x <
0$. Here our $W(x)$ refers to the lower\footnote{The upper branch is
$W_0(x) > -1$ when $-1 < x < 0$} branch $W_{-1}(x) < -1$. This
second approximation that converges to the optimal one when $n$ is large:

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem:approx1}
Suppose that the optimal $\alpha$ is $\alpha^*$ which
satisfies equation \ref{eq:alpha}. Then $\alpha = (-W(-1-\rho))^{-1/n}$ satisfies
$$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} C(\alpha^*) = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} C(\alpha = (-W(-1-\rho))^{-1/n})$$
That is, our approximation's cost will converge to optimal cost when $n$ grows to
infinity.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Define sequence $\alpha^*_n, C^*_n$ where $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ to be sequences of
optimal $\alpha^*$ and corresponding optimal cost $C^*$ when there are $n$
bidders. We first show that $C^*_n$ is increasing: if we make
$(\alpha_{n-1})^{n-1} = (\alpha^*_n)^n$, then we have 1) The expected broadcast
cost of $\alpha_{n-1}$-MVA with $n-1$ bidders is equal to that of
$\alpha^*_n$-MVA with $n$ bidders as the probability that one round will
terminate is the same; 2) $\alpha_{n-1} < \alpha^*_n$ thus the expected bidding
cost of $\alpha_{n-1}$-MVA with $n-1$ bidders should be less than that of
$\alpha^*_n$-MVA with $n$ bidders. Therefore, $C^*_{n-1} \leq C_{n-1}(\alpha_{n-1}) < C^*_n$.
Thus sequence $C^*$ is indeed strictly increasing.

Secondly, theorem \ref{theorem:approx1} says $C^*_n$ is bounded. Therefore
$(1-\alpha^*)n$ must also be bounded otherwise $C = \frac{\rho+(1-\alpha)n}{1-\alpha^n}$ cannot be bounded.
Thus according to Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem [cite wikipedia?], there must be
a subsequence $\alpha^*_{n_i}$ such that $(1-\alpha^*_{n_i})n$ converges to some constant $A$.
Recall that $\alpha^*$ satisfies equation \ref{eq:alpha} and obviously $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \alpha^* = 1$, 
we could use calculations similar to what we used for equation \ref{eq:approx2} to derive
\begin{align*}
&\lim_{n_i \rightarrow \infty} (1-\alpha^*_{n_i})n_i = A = -1-\rho-W(-1-\rho)\\
&\lim_{n_i \rightarrow \infty} (\alpha^*_{n_i})^{n_i} = \lim_{n_i \rightarrow \infty} (\alpha^*_{n_i})^{n_i-1} = (-W(-1-\rho))^{-1}
\end{align*}
This proves that
$$\lim_{n_i \rightarrow \infty} C(\alpha^*) = \lim_{n_i \rightarrow \infty} C(\alpha = (-W(-1-\rho))^{-1/n_i})$$
Then using the fact that $C^*_n$ is strictly increasing and bounded completes the proof.
\end{proof}

Experiments in figure \ref{fig:alpha} compare the optimal $\alpha$, our first approximation
of $\alpha = 1-1/n$ and our second approximation $\alpha = (-W(-1-\rho))^{-1/n}$
together with their corresponding cost under settings $\rho = 0.2, 1, 5$.

  $\alpha$} 
  \label{fig:alpha}
\end{figure*}

As figure \ref{fig:alpha} shows, the first approximation $1-1/n$ is bounded
to be a constant time of optimal cost while the second approximation converges to optimal
cost when $n$ grows large. When $\rho$ is close to $1$, both two
approximations are very close to the optimal one. But the second approximation is much better
when $\rho$ is much smaller or greater than $1$. Anyway, the second approximation is not always
better than the first approximation, as the case $\rho = 1, n = 2$ shows.

\subsection{Experiments}\label{sec:eff_experiment}
Now let us compare optimal $\alpha$-MVA with other kinds of MVA. In all
following experiments, the valuation distribution is always uniform over $[0,
1]$. According to lemma \ref{lemma:uniform}, other distributions can always be
adapted to uniform distribution so this will not be a problem.  Also recall that
under this simpler model, the revenue is fixed thus the profit is
completely determined by cost. Thus we will only compare cost.

$\alpha$-MVA can potentially have infinite many rounds. But in reality, it is
more naturaly to come up with an MVA that has finite many, say $k$ rounds at
most. Let us call them $k$-MVA where $k$ is some positive integers. One
particualr $k$- MVA is uniform $k$-MVA where the $k$ thresholds is uniformly
distributed over $[0, 1]$.  It is also known as fixed-step search strategy in
\cite{SarneSR2010:IncreasingSearch, DBLP:conf/iwdc/HassanJ04}. An optimal uniform MVA is the uniform
$k$-MVA that minimize the cost by choosing the best $k$.

In practice, such $k$ might also be very limited. For example, if someone need
to sell something in $3$ days before moving out, the $k$ might be limited to
$3$ since it is too annoying to send out two broadcast messages per day (e.g. it
might be labeled as spam by selling platform).  With this limitation, one can
still use uniform thresholds as a baseline. Or we may formulate this as another
optimzing problem and solve the best $k$ thresholds under this constraint (this
problem is defined and solved in section \ref{sec:general_analysis} and
equation \ref{eq:diff_C_general}).  Between the baseline $k$ uniform thresholds
and the optimal $k$ thresholds, another heurestic way to get $k$ thresholds is
to use $\alpha, \alpha^2, \ldots, \alpha^{k-1}$ as thresholds. That means, in
first $k-1$ rounds, we query as if we have infinite many rounds, and we query
all the left in last round. We call this mechanism as $\alpha$-cutoff-$k$-MVA.

The comparison results achieved from simulation experiments are shown in figure
\ref{fig:cost_comparisons}. Here are some observations:

    \subfigure[$\rho = 0.5$]{
        \includegraphics[trim=0 5mm 5mm 15mm, clip, width=.3\linewidth]{figures/analyze_cost_.5_5_15.eps}

    }
    \caption{Cost comparison for different MVAs over $n$, number of bidders, and $\rho$, broadcast/bidding cost ratio.}
    \label{fig:cost_comparisons}
\end{figure*}

\begin{itemize}
\item The optimal uniform-MVA's cost is very close to optimal $\alpha$-MVA's,
especially when $n$ is large. That is probably because
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\alpha$ approaching $1$ when $n$ grows large, which makes the
        first $k$ thresholds $\alpha, \alpha^2, \alpha^3, \ldots, \alpha^k$
        close to uniform thresholds $1-(1-\alpha), 1-2(1-\alpha), \ldots,
        1-k(1-\alpha)$; 

        \item the probability that the highest value falls out of first $k$
        thresholds, $\alpha^{nk}$, becomes negligible for large $n$.
    \end{enumerate}

\item The optimal $k$-MVA's cost decreases and approaches to optimal cost quickly
when $k$ grows (check optimal $2$-MVA and $3$-MVA).

\item When $k$ is small, uniform thresholds has significant higher cost than optimal
$k$-MVA, and the heuristic $\alpha$-cutoff-$k$-MVA.

\item The heuristic $\alpha$-cutoff-$k$-MVA works pretty well especially when
$\rho$ is large as shown in figure \ref{fig:cost_comparison_.5}. But it is not
as good as optimal $2$-MVA when $\rho$ is small and $n$ is large as shown in
figure \ref{fig:cost_comparison_2}. Thus find the right thresholds is even more
important than adding one more round in those cases.

\end{itemize}
